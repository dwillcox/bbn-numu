The python script posttnu.py reformats the output file so the numbers are in two columns.

The enclosed fortran program tnudec.f90 is a test case for computing the neutrino decoupling temperature and demonstrates two ways of computing the problematic cube roots. The directory wrongthird contains output for which the computation returns NaN and the directory correctthird contains the corrected outputs. 

See the comments in tnudec.f90 for more details.
