These are the project files for investigating the effects of a neutrino magnetic moment on big-bang nucleosynthesis using F.Timmes' BBN code.

General Notes:
++"baseline" directories are abundance calculations using eta=6.2e-10 with unmodified, vanilla bbn code.
++"cyburt" directories correspond to the version of the bbn code obtained from the TALENT document server.
++"cococubed" directories correspond to the version of the bbn code obtained from F. Timmes' website.

Specific Directories:
++"bigbang_cyburt_time_convergence" demonstrates that 1e6 seconds is sufficiently long that the abundances are afterwards unchanged.
++"bigbang_cyburt_numu" contains the code and results for inclusion of a neutrino magnetic moment.
++"testtnudec" contains a standalone computation of the neutrino decoupling temperature vs. magnetic moment and is useful for debugging.
