plotmulti*.gp are the gnuplot scripts to plot abundances vs. either magnetic moment (numu) or decoupling temperature (tdec) depending on whether the calculation was parameterized by numu or tdec.

plottemp.gp is a gnuplot script which plots decoupling temperature vs. magnetic moment for a calculation parameterized by numu.

postbb.py is for reformatting the output file of a numu run so the data is in the right columns instead of one long column.
